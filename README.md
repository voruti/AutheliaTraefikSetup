# AutheliaTraefikSetup

Clone onto two machines, insert your configuration in `.env` and start one stack per machine.

The domain names should point to the correct hosts:

```txt
authelia.example.com        ->  host1
traefik-host1.example.com   ->  host1
service-host1.example.com   ->  host1
traefik-host2.example.com   ->  host2
service-host2.example.com   ->  host2
```
